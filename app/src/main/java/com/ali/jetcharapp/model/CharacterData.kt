Zoro’s extraordinarily powerful three-sword style of fighting mixed with his sheer will and determination to become the greatest swordsman in the world make him a formidable foe. Though he spends a lot of time sleeping, and is near on impossible to wake, he is always raring to go when there’s a fight to be won, especially if it’s against another swordsman. But a word of advice: never let Zoro lead the way, as his abysmal sense of direction allows him to get lost even when following a straight path!",

In order to cement their friendship and ensure that they meet again, Shanks gave Luffy his straw hat, which has since become the rubber man’s greatest treasure.",
